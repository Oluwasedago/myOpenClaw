## 🧠 What This Does

This repository contains a **single Bash script** that:

1. Copies your X/Twitter archive from Windows → WSL
2. Extracts and merges multiple ZIP files
3. Parses JavaScript-wrapped JSON data
4. Extracts structured data:
   - ✅ Your **Profile** (identity)
   - ✅ Your **Tweets** (voice, opinions, thinking)
   - ✅ Your **Bookmarks** (research, interests)
   - ✅ Your **Likes** (engagement patterns)
   - ✅ Your **Following** (intellectual network)
5. Combines everything into a single clean text file
6. Splits output into Telegram-friendly chunks (< 4000 chars)
7. Ready to paste into OpenClaw for AI memory ingestion

## ⚠️ Important Distinction

> We are **not training** an AI model.
>
> We are building **contextual memory**.
>
> Your tweets = your thinking.
> Your bookmarks = your research brain.
> Your likes = your subconscious interests.
> Your following = your intellectual network.
